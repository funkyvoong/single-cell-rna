In “Sexually Dimorphic Control of
Parenting Behavior by the Medial Amygdala”
the data set used, GSE124061, aimed to examine
the role of the medial amygdala in controlling
parenting and infanticide behaviors in male and
female mice. Through single-cell transcriptomic
analysis, the authors of the paper found that sex
differences in the medial amygdala are
specifically represented in GABAergic neurons.
In this analysis of dataset GSE124061, the aim is
to recreate the results of “Sexually Dimorphic
Control of Parenting Behavior by the Medial
Amygdala”; test different GABAergic gene sets
on the full GSE124061 data set to see if there are
any interesting clusterings or gene expressions,
and also to test different classification methods
to see which one is most successful.
